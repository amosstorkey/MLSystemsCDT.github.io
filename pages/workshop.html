title: The First Edinburgh Workshop on Affordable Machine Learning
---
<div>
  <h1> The First Edinburgh Workshop on Affordable Machine Learning</h1>
  <h3>30th June 2023 (09:00-17:00)<br>Informatics Forum (IF G.07), 10 Crichton Street, Edinburgh</h3>
  <p>
    Machine learning has revolutionised various fields by enabling intelligent systems to learn from data and make informed decisions. However, the widespread adoption of machine learning techniques often faces barriers due to high computing and data requirements, limiting access to these powerful tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Schools of Informatics and Engineering at The University of Edinburgh are hosting a workshop on Affordable Machine Learning, aiming to bridge this gap by exploring methods, strategies, and tools that enable affordable machine learning implementations.
  </p>
  <p>
    This workshop will provide a platform for researchers and industrial practitioners to share insights, experiences, and innovations in developing machine learning solutions that are both computationally affordable and data efficient. We will have invited talks from experts conducting research in this area, and participants will engage in discussions and interactive sessions to explore alternative approaches and novel techniques that reduce the computational and data burdens while achieving other performance desiderata.

    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p>
      Participants will need to make their own travel arrangements. By train the nearest station is Edinburgh Waverley, which is less than a 15 minute walk from the forum. See <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk">National Rail Enquiries</a> for train information. For those coming from further afield, information about <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/transport/public-transport/air">travel to and from Edinburgh Airport is available</a>. A taxi to the city centre from the airport costs about 30GBP one way. There is an express bus from the airport called Airlink that terminates in the city centre and costs around 10GBP for a return journey. The journey to the airport requires approximately 30 minutes from the city centre of actual journey time (add a little more during the rush hours). There is also a tram that goes to the centre of town. It takes a little longer than the bus, and is a bit cheaper.
