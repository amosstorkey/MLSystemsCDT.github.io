The Bayesian and Neural Systems Group (which somehow became informally known as BayesWatch) is the machine learning research group founded by Amos Storkey. Many members are based across the <a href='http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk'>School of Informatics</a> and the <a href='https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk'>School of Engineering</a> at the University of Edinburgh.
