Bonseyes is an open and expandable AI platform. It will transform AI development from a cloud centric model, dominated by large internet companies, to an edge device centric model through a marketplace and an open AI platform.

At Edinburgh, we contribute to the deep learning toolbox. The deep Learning Toolbox will extend existing open source deep frameworks to provide a set of components that are tailored for embedded, constrained, distributed systems operating in real environments with power, memory, and speed constraints.
